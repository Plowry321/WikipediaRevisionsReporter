## Markdown Tips

If you are unfamiliar with MarkDown, check out 
[the official documentation](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Note that IntelliJ IDEA has a Markdown preview that you can access in 
the upper-right of the editor. Also, since Markdown documents&mdash;like
source code&mdash;should be human-readable, make sure you keep your lines
short, as you can see I have done in my Markdown files.

Please remove this subsection before submitting your report. 

## Challenge #1 Complete

For challenge #1 I replaced FakeQueryEngine with WikipediaQueryEngine in the QueryEngineModel class.

## Challenge #2 Complete

For challenge #2 I created an interface called FormatInterface and used implemented it in a new Revision formatter called NewRevisionFormatter.

## Challenge #3 Complete

For challenge #3, instead of using the stringbuilder and for loop, I used the stream api.

## Reflection Question #1: Functional vs OO

(Write one or more paragraphs comparing and contrasting the iterative and functional  
approaches to string concatenation you explored in challenge #3. Which do you
prefer, and why?)

## Reflection Question #2: Polymorphism and Dependency Inversion

(Explain how polymorphism engendered dependency inversion in this little
application. Be clear and precise here, as this is, in part, an assessment of
your correct use of technical terminology.
Consider, for example, where exactly is polymorphism used?
Where exactly is a dependency inverted?)
